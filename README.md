# Chess-Clock
A JavaScript-based chess clock aimed at mobile devices (primarily Chrome for Android at this point). 
Allows for custom time control for each player, though increment must be the same. 
This chess clock supports Fischer, Bronstein, and Simple delay settings.

On the computer, a keypress or clicking the buttons can be used to switch players.
On a mobile device, swiping and tapping (multi-touch or single-touch) can be used to switch players.
